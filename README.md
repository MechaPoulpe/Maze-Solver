"# Maze-Solver" 

How to init the project :
- clone the repo
- edit the file 'index.js' to build your own maze (check rules under this How to)
- execute 'node index.js' to solve your maze :)


LEGEND MAZE

Void : 0

Wall: 1

Starting point: 2

Finish point: 3




Exemple of maze :

 [

  [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3],

  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],

  [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],

  [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
  
]

Rules :

- Require a starting point (2)
- Require a finish point (3)
- Require a REAL way to solve the maze (or prepare you for infinite loop :D)

HAVE FUN :)
